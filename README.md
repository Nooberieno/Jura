## Expanding core features
- [ ] Ctrl + G to go to a specific line
- [ ] text selection with the keyboard, potentially using Ctrl + Arrow keys
- [ ] copy and paste without relying on the text selection of the mouse and terminal emulator
- [ ] changing the copy and paste keybinds to Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V
## Not certain yet
these feature suggestion are **not** confirmed yet, but may be implemented in the future
