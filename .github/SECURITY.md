# Security Policy
If you find any bugs, issues or unsafe behaviour you can always report them.

Check the Reporting a Vulnerability section to see how you should report bugs and issues.

If you are on a older version of jura, consider updating as some bugs may have been fixed in between versions.

This also means that I will not be updating older versions of jura as the bugs likely have discoverd and fixed in testing newer versions

## Supported Versions

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Any minor bugs may be posted to the issues tab

For major bugs or issues, check the README to make sure that they are not already being worked on

If they are not in the bugs section you may post them to the issues tab or email me at <nooberieno.dev@gmail.com>, please only do this for major bugs and issues

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

   * The type of issue(e.g. stack overflow, code injection, segmentation fault)
   * The part of the source code you believe to be the issue in function names or line numbers(if possible)
   * Any special configuration to reproduce the issue
   * A step-by-step guide on how to recreate the issue(if possible)
   * Proof of concept or code exploit(if possible)
   * The impact of the issue if you are posting it to the issues tab(e.g. minor, major, critical, quality of life)

Providing this info will help me in solving vulnerabilities as quickly and efficiently as possible

If there are any bugs with depency functions, all of those have to do with issues in glibc, please report those to your glibc provider,unless it has something to do with my implementation of these functions
